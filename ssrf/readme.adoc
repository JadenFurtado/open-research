= SSRFs

Server-side request forgery (SSRF) is a security vulnerability that allows an attacker to trick a server into making unintended requests to internal or external resources: 

How it works: An attacker manipulates a web application or API to make requests to internal resources. This can happen when an application doesn't validate or sanitize a URL input before pulling data from a remote resource. 

*Consequences:* SSRF can lead to: 

Unauthorized access 

* Data exposure 
* System compromise 
* Remote code execution 
*  Access to internal systems 
* Extraction of sensitive data 
* Further attacks within the organization's network 

*Prevention:* A quick fix is to sanitize user data in calls to other servers. 

SSRF is a severe vulnerability that's regularly discovered and may appear in all networked software. It's listed as CWE-918 in the Common Weakness Enumeration, a community-developed list of software and hardware weaknesses.
